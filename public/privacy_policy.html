Notice and Choice
We collect Personal Information, Non-Personal Information, and Public Information.

We collect Personal Information when you provide it to us, for example by creating an account. We may ask for your email address if you wish to be notified when listings have changed, for confirmation emails, authenticating your account, accounting notices and other reasons including instances in which you have requested specific information or updates.

If you use Facebook or Google to create an account on any of our network sites, we will receive information such as your name and email address, as well as other information you may provide to us through those services. These companies may also receive certain data as described in their privacy policies.

We do not share the Personal Information you provide to us with third parties. However we do provide Personal Information to our vendors or others who are acting to fulfill the services we provide. For example, servers we use to host our website and store information may be managed by other vendors in order to make our site more reliable.

We collect Public Information when you provide it to us for public display or when we assemble information from publicly accessible databases in order to help you find services or conduct research. For example, some listings ask for, require or include names, phone numbers, email addresses, and other personally identifiable information. This information is optional and is intended to benefit you, your business, or the item listed to assist with promotion or display. If you post information in reviews, or make edits to a listing, please be aware that you have made this information public.

Please do not post any Personal Information on listings that you wish to keep private. If you have provided us with information that you wish to remove you may edit that listing or contact us directly to remove that information. Please be aware that if the information has originated in a public database you will need to contact the source of this information to ensure this information does not continue to be displayed in the future. You may find the source of such information on the bottom of the listing page or by contacting us directly.

We collect Non-Personal Information such as web-logs to help us to diagnose problems with our system and to provide better services to our customers. These logs are deleted on a regular basis.

We and our vendors use cookies, web beacons, advertising identifiers, and other tracking technologies to understand site usage and to manage our advertising and affiliate relationships. Furthermore, emails we send may contain a web beacon that allows us to understand the time and date of when a user has opened an email and when he or she has used a link within an email to visit a website. We use third-party vendors, including Google, for analytics and to serve advertisements and collect non-personally identifiable information when you visit one of our websites. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (not including your name, address, human-readable email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements on our sites, other websites, and other forms of media, including emails, about goods and services that may be of interest to you.
